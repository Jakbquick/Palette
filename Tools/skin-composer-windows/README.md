This project is programmed in Java and depends on LibGDX and the LWJGL3 backend.

### Skin Composer ###

* Use Skin Composer to create skins for scene2d.ui
* Version 19

### Changes ###

* Fixed locale error causing crash bug in the FreeType dialog.
* Fixed crash with font in custom class when rendering table.
* Fixed export not acknowledging custom class with font set to a FreeType font.

### Notes ###

To run Skin Composer on OSX, download the skin_composer_mac.jar version of the app and run it via terminal with the following command: **java -jar -XstartOnFirstThread skin_composer_mac.jar**

Contributer RaimundWege has shared the following information for anyone who is working from source in Android Studio on Mac.

* You have to go to 'File/Project Structure...' and set the project language level to '8 - Lambdas, type annotations etc.'
* The line: 'config.setWindowSizeLimits(675, 400, -1, -1);' in DesktopLauncher throws NoSuchMethodError (no idea why). So this line needs to be commented out.
* You have to start the project with the vm option: -XstartOnFirstThread

These will remain as issues until I can get my hands a proper Mac to do testing. AFAIK, the compiled version should work fine on Mac systems.
